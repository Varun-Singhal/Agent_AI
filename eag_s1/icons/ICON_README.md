# Icon Files Required

This extension requires the following icon files in the `icons/` directory:

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows taskbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Suggestions

The icon should represent tab management or organization. Consider:
- Multiple overlapping rectangles (representing tabs)
- A clean, minimalist design
- Colors that match the extension's theme (purple/blue gradient)
- Clear visibility at small sizes

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva)
- Online icon generators
- Vector graphics software (Illustrator, Inkscape)

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images
3. The extension will work without proper icons, but they'll appear as broken image icons

## Icon Guidelines

- Use PNG format for best compatibility
- Ensure icons are square (same width and height)
- Use high contrast for small sizes
- Consider both light and dark themes
